fibonacci

- Fibonacci /n
	takes parameter n and returns n-th number of Fibonacci sequence along with three following numbers {Fn, ... ,Fn+3}
	
- Primes /Fn+3
	takes the Fn+3 from Fibonacci result and returns list of all Prime numbers less or equal to this number for further use {2,3,5, ... ,P}
	
- Deconstruction /Fn /{2,3,5, ... ,P}
	takes a number from Fibonacci sequence and using the array of Primes generated before runs following recurrent algorithm
	
	substract the largest possible Prime Px from the array and call Deconstruction /Fn-Px /{2,3,5, ... ,Px}
	repeat this with all lesser Primes
	
	Inevitably, each branch will run to either a 1 or a 0 remnant. Branches ending with 1 are discarded as 1 is not a Prime number. Branches ending with 0 will return an string which will acumulate all the summands that add up to Fibonacci number at the root of the tree.
	
	this function returns the list of all the valid strings generated by the tree. Tha nature of the algorithm used ensures, that not only are all returned strings valid, the numbers within each are ordered and every result is unique within the tree.
	
	{string1,string2, ... ,stringZ}
	
	--algorithm redacted to perform the addition and multiplication within the valid subtrees on the go to reduce amount of required memory allocation (heap overflow occuring since parameter n=10 and further with the version 1)
	
	
- Monster /n
	this algorithm takes number n submitted by user and calls previously defined functions in such a matter, that the result given is corresponding number K for every Fibonacci number from our initial set of four
	
	result: {K(Fn), ... ,K(Fn+3)}
	
Database extension:

In order to introduce basic "machine learning" concept, upon first calculation of certain result, this result shall be logged into attached noSQL database and fetched in case such result is required again. In simillar matter, all numbers considered during calculating relevant Primes for previously executed jobs are logged into the same database with the information whether or not they are prime numbers, in order to avoid further recalculations of prime numbers. Algorithm will determine which numbers need to be calculated additionally in case not all required primes are logged into the database.

http://localhost:5900/fibonacci/_design/newDesignDoc/_view/numbers?descending=true&limit=1 - find largest number logged into the database

http://localhost:5900/fibonacci/_design/newDesignDoc/_view/primes?startkey=1&endkey=10 - fetch all prime numbers within the given interval

- log new number to the database using POST method to http://localhost:5900/fibonacci/ with the document embed in the body of the request

http://localhost:5900/fibonacci/_design/newDesignDoc/_view/results?key=3 - fetch result of previously calculated job (if no such job was previously calculated, 0 rows are fetched from the database)

- log new result to the database using POST method to http://localhost:5900/fibonacci/ with the document embed in the body of the request
